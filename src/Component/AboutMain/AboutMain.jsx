                            <p>After graduating in 2022 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree (First Class Honours) in Multimedia Programming and Design, I spent the last one years working both as a freelance web developer and designer. I acquired project and time management skills, as well as the ability to communicate with team members and clients while effectively meeting milestones and deadlines.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                As a freelance web developer and designer I collaborated with several graphic designers in Berlin and Melbourne, at the same time maintaining clients in Germany, Ireland, Australia and the UK.

                                <br />
                                I have worked on a multitude of web and print based projects for a range of clients providing Web Design (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) and Development (HTML, CSS, JS, React js, WordPress, WooCommerce, Bootstrap, Responsive Layouts), Corporate Branding. During my Multimedia degree I studied Information Architecture, and therefore have a keen understanding of wireframes, sitemaps and user experience design which I put to good use on every project I work on.
